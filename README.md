# My userscripts collection

A personal collection of userscripts I use across the internet. Each script is designed to automate, enhance, or simplify specific web experiences according to my own needs.

## Overview

This repository hosts various userscripts, each targeting different websites. All scripts are written and maintained for personal use, but others may find them useful as well. That's why I shared them with the public.

- Scripts are located in the `src/` directory, organized by website or purpose.
- Each script includes metadata at the top for easy installation via userscript managers like Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey.
- All scripts are licensed under the MIT License, unless stated otherwise.

## Usage

1. Install the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or any other userscript manager in your browser.
2. Browse the `src/` directory to find a userscript you want to use.
3. Click the script file `index.user.js`. In the upper-right corner of the file view, click Raw.
4. Install the script using your preferred userscript manager.
